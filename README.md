# PokeAPI Rails

`pokeapi-rails` is a Rails implementation of the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) platform.

It keeps `/api/v2` behavior compatible with the existing ecosystem while building and stabilizing a normalized `/api/v3` surface with stronger contracts, performance checks, and generated OpenAPI docs.
